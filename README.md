# Config manager app

An application for managing configuration files for mainly games. Only CS:GO is supported in the beginning, possibly more later on.

## Usage

By creating an account you can save and share your favorite configurations, so that you can easily switch between multiple configurations, and also have them backed up in cloud. This helps manage your personalized configurations between multiple computers, and saves the hassle of always having to set them up when starting with a new system.
